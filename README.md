# AI-Driven DevOps Workshop

> **Hands-on educational repo for DevOps engineers learning to integrate AI and LLMs into their workflows.**

---

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository was created as part of an internal workshop to bring clarity and structure to the growing world of AI tools in the context of DevOps engineering.

It is designed for **beginners** who want to:
- Understand how AI and LLMs can be practically applied to DevOps workflows
- Learn foundational concepts through clear, working demos
- Explore real-world use cases (incident analysis, CI feedback, chatbot integrations, etc.)
- Get inspired to build their own AI-powered operational tools

> This is **not a product**, library, or production-ready toolkit. It is a learning-focused resource built for internal knowledge-sharing.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Introduce common DevOps processes where AI/LLMs can provide value
- Present a practical, example-based learning environment
- Demonstrate best practices in prompt design, inference orchestration, and automation flow
- Help teams identify areas in their infrastructure where AI can reduce toil and accelerate insight

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All code in this repository is intended for **demo purposes only**. While the examples are functional, they are:
- Not security hardened
- Not optimized for performance
- Not tested at scale

They are meant to provide a **strong starting point**, not a plug-and-play solution.

Use these examples as inspiration and modify them before applying to production environments.
